# **Model Deployement**

Predicting Description

predicting the selling price of the car based on various features of the cars including the present price of the cars, will be using some of the Random Forest and LinearRegression for building The model.

The process of deploying a machine learning model in a live environment. The model can be deployed across a range of different environments and will often be integrated with apps through an API. Deployment is a key step in an organisation gaining operational value from machine learning.

There are actions which made to be evolved during the deployment and featuring.
    
    Actions 1: Retrain the model with new data.
    Actions 2: Retrain the model with additional features.
    Actions 3: Develop a new model from scratch.
